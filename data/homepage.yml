  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    As a rising junior studying computer science and economics, I am interested in 
    empowering people through behavior design and solving
    high-level problems. I love working in teams
    where I can wear many hats, adapting and using both technical and non-technical skills
    to tackle new challenges. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Outside of coursework, I lead as managing director of Helix (an undergraduate healthcare tech
    incubator), I play on the Yale Mens Club Volleyball Team, 
    and I help coordinate student art exhibitions as Events Chair for Art Exhibition Students at Yale.

    title: "What's Keeping Me Busy Right Now"
    content: '<p class="lead">
    I''m currently working at ApolloMed as a software engineer intern, doing full-stack web app development
    with Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, JS, and SQL Server.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I also started volunteering for the data science team at 
    <a href="https://getusppe.org/" target="_blank">GetUsPPE.org</a>, the largest organization in the US
    helping coordinate PPE donations to frontline healthcare workers. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Additionally, I recently took <a href="https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&q=EDUC+302%3A+Behavior+Design&collapse=" target="_blank">
    EDUC 302 Behavior Design for Coronavirus Challenges</a>, a course
    taught at Stanford by <a href="https://www.bjfogg.com/" target="_blank">BJ Fogg</a>. Because of the global 
    nature of the course topic for this year, the class was open to non-Stanford students to apply.
    I worked on a variety of projects that harness the power of behavior design 
    to solve some of the problems people are facing due to the pandemic.
    For example, my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bEIYd4IEjc" target="_blank">personal project</a> 
    utilized anchor behaviors in my own life to prompt 
    me to call my grandparents every day and keep in touch. Here&#39s another project I 
    did to <a href="https://youtu.be/nnaJI8--F0U" target="_blank">help couples in long distance relationships</a>.
    My final project was <a href="https://queuepalsprojectvideo.alexchen.dev/" 
    target="_blank">QueuePals</a>, 
    a virtual waiting room solution to help patients
    safely check into their doctor''s appointments over text message.
